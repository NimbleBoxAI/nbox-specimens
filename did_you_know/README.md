- `kuramoto.py`: The Kuramoto Effect is a phenomenon in physics where individual oscillators synchronize over time, like a group of people clapping together in unison. It's like a musical orchestra, but instead of musicians, it's a bunch of pendulums or lasers or neurons. It's like a dance party where everyone starts moving to the same beat, but instead of humans, it's a bunch of fireflies or chemical reactions. So, if you ever find yourself clapping along to a song with your friends, just remember that you're experiencing the Kuramoto Effect in action!
